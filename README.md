</details>

### Host → Server Transfer

<details>
<summary>Click to expand host to server transfer guide</summary>

1. Copy `Level.sav` and `Players` folder from host save
2. Paste to dedicated server save folder
3. Start server, create a new character
4. Wait for auto-save, then close
5. Use **Fix Host Save** to migrate GUIDs
6. Copy files back and launch

**Using Fix Host Save:**
- Select the `Level.sav` from your temporary folder
- Choose the **old character** (from original save)
- Choose the **new character** (you just created)
- Click **Migrate**

</details>

### Host Swap (Changing Host)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand host swap guide</summary>

**Background:**
- Host always uses `0001.sav` — same UID for whoever hosts
- Each client uses a unique regular UID save (e.g., `123xxx.sav`, `987xxx.sav`)

**Prerequisites:**
Both players (old host and new host) must have their regular saves generated. This happens by joining the host's world and creating a new character.

**Steps:**

1. **Ensure Regular Saves Exist**
   - Player A (old host) should have a regular save (e.g., `123xxx.sav`)
   - Player B (new host) should have a regular save (e.g., `987xxx.sav`)

2. **Swap Old Host's Host Save to Regular Save**
   - Use PalworldSaveTools **Fix Host Save** to swap:
   - Old host's `0001.sav` → `123xxx.sav`
   - (This moves old host's progress from host slot to their regular player slot)

3. **Swap New Host's Regular Save to Host Save**
   - Use PalworldSaveTools **Fix Host Save** to swap:
   - New host's `987xxx.sav` → `0001.sav`
   - (This moves new host's progress into the host slot)

**Result:**
- Player B is now the host with their own character and pals in `0001.sav`
- Player A becomes a client with their original progress in `123xxx.sav`

</details>

### Base Export/Import

## Troubleshooting

### "VCRUNTIME140.dll was not found"

**Solution:** Install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)

### `struct.error` when parsing save

**Cause:** Outdated save file format

**Solution:**
1. Load the save in the game (Solo, Coop, or Dedicated Server mode)
2. This triggers an automatic structure update
3. Ensure the save was updated on or after the latest game patch

### GamePass converter not working

**Solution:**
1. Close the GamePass version of Palworld
2. Wait a few minutes
3. Run the Steam → GamePass converter
4. Launch Palworld on GamePass to verify
